Their sound has evolved tremendously over time, so I'd like to know which era of Radiohead you enjoy most - their earlier guitar-driven work like 'The Bends', their electronic experimentation on 'Kid A', or their more recent atmospheric compositions? Also, what specific elements draw you to their music - Thom Yorke's vocals, the complex arrangements, the emotional depth, or the experimental production? This will help me recommend bands that capture what you love about Radiohead while introducing you to fresh sounds."

To make it perfectly matched to your exercise style, I'd need to know a few things: What type of workout do you typically do (high-intensity intervals, steady cardio, weight training, yoga)? Do you prefer a specific genre as your workout soundtrack? And importantly, what BPM (beats per minute) range works best - do you need fast-paced tracks to push through intense sections or more moderate tempos for consistent energy? This will help me craft a playlist that keeps you motivated throughout your entire workout."
