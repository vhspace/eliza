I look at several key factors: location growth trends, rental demand in the area, price-to-rent ratio, property tax rates, potential appreciation based on local development, and carrying costs including maintenance. Are you considering a specific property or area? And are you looking for long-term appreciation, immediate rental income, or both? Understanding your investment goals will help me provide more targeted advice for your situation."
