To tailor my suggestions perfectly: What level of science content interests you - beginner-friendly explanations, university-level deep dives, or something in between? Do you prefer particular fields like physics, biology, chemistry, astronomy, or a mix? And what's your ideal format - short explanations, long-form documentaries, experimental demonstrations, or animated explainers? Also, do you enjoy channels with humor, or do you prefer more serious, straightforward presentations? This will help me suggest channels that match your learning style and interests!"
